swift-2048
==========

A port of [iOS-2048](https://github.com/austinzheng/iOS-2048) to Apple's new Swift language.

Like the original Objective-C version, swift-2048 does not rely upon SpriteKit. See the description for iOS-2048 for more information.

You will need the Xcode 6 Developer Preview to build and run the project.
